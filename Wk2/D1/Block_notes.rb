## what is a block?
# a block is a chunk of code that is passed into a method to be executed.

## block basics
# Brace {...} blocks and do...end blocks are functionally equivalent,
#  we just prefer do...end for blocks that contain many lines.
#
# Blocks can accept parameters if we name them between pipes (|param_1, param_2, etc.|).
#
# We know that when we pass a block into map, map will execute the block,
# passing in every element of the array one by one. It will take each evaluation
# of the block and make that value an element of the new array that the map method will return.
#
# Blocks are somewhat similar to methods in that both can contain lines of code
# as well as take in parameters. However, an important distinction to make is
# that the return keyword pertains to methods, not blocks. Let's take a look at a common pitfall:
# Correct:
def double_eles(arr)
  arr.map do |ele|
    ele * 2
  end
end
double_eles([1,2,3]) #=> [2,4,6]


# Incorrect:
def double_eles(arr)
  arr.map do |ele|
    return ele * 2
  end
end
double_eles([1,2,3]) #=> 2
----
# Looking at the incorrect implementation of double_eles, we use the return keyword
#  within the block. If we use return we will be returning out of the entire double_eles
#  method on the first iteration of map. In other words, using return in a block will
#  not make the block evaluate to the return value. The return will force the outer
#  method to evaluate to the return value. This is a huge reason why we should treat
#  blocks and methods as somewhat distinct concepts.

## Using Methods as Blocks
# It is very, very common to have blocks that take an argument and call a single
#method. For example

["a", "b", "c"].map { |str| str.upcase }  #=> ["A", "B", "C"]
[1, 2, 5].select { |num| num.odd? }       #=> [1, 5]

#ruby allows us to use clearner syntax when we have simple blocks that follow
#the above patter. LEt's refactor the abnove example to use this shortcut:

["a", "b", "c"].map(&:upcase) #=> ["A", "B", "C"]
[1, 2, 5].select(&:odd?)      #=> [1, 5]

# You may find this syntax quite strange. Let's notice a few things about how we
#are using "map". We call map  and pass in a single argument, "&:upcase".
#:upcase is a symbol referring to the String#upcase method. We use & to convert
#this "method" into an objevt that we can pass into map. In ruby, we  cannont directly pass a
#method into another method, so we need to use the & operator. In the next lecture we'll explore
#the intricacies of "&"

# for now, here's hard and fast rule you can use to optimize some blocks.
# If you are calling a mehtod like map, passing a block that has this general structure

array.map { |block_param| block_param.method }
#Then you can rewrite it as:

array.map(&:method)
#When employing this trick, be aware of what &:method you are using. The method you choose
#should be compatible with your data:

["a", "b", "c"].map(&:upcase) # => ["A", "B", "C"]
[1, 2, 3].map(&:upcase)       # NoMethodError: undefined method 'upcase' for Integer
